Files needed for the program to run:
	Makefile
	SurveyEntry.h
	node.h
	node.c
	list.h
	list.c
	main.h
	main.c

the executable, when made with make all, is called lab2

all other files are not needed to run the program, they are just the files i used to test/make it

Makefile:
	make main: compiles just the main file
	make node: compiles just the node file
	make list: compiles just the list file
